# RC4-in-Python

Description:
This project provides a Python implementation of the RC4 (Rivest Cipher 4) encryption algorithm. RC4 is a widely-used symmetric stream cipher known for its simplicity and speed. It is commonly utilized in various cryptographic applications to ensure secure communication and data confidentiality.

Key Features:
1. Encryption and Decryption: The RC4 implementation offers functions to encrypt and decrypt data using the RC4 algorithm. It takes a secret key as input and applies the RC4 keystream to transform the plaintext into ciphertext, and vice versa for decryption.

2. Key Scheduling: The project includes an efficient key scheduling algorithm that generates a permutation of all possible byte values based on the secret key provided. This permutation is used to generate a stream of pseudo-random bytes, which is then XORed with the plaintext to produce ciphertext.

3. Flexibility and Compatibility: The RC4 implementation supports variable key lengths, allowing users to specify keys of different sizes. It ensures compatibility with other systems or protocols that utilize RC4 encryption with varying key lengths.

4. Performance Optimization: The implementation is optimized for performance, making use of Python's built-in data structures and operations to ensure efficient execution of the encryption and decryption processes.

5. Code Readability and Modularity: The project follows best practices for code readability and modularity, making it easy to understand, modify, and integrate into other projects. Clear documentation is provided to guide users through the implementation details and usage.

This Python implementation of the RC4 encryption algorithm serves as a valuable resource for developers and security enthusiasts. It offers a practical reference for understanding and implementing RC4 encryption in Python, providing a foundation for secure communication and data protection.

Whether you are a beginner seeking to learn about symmetric stream ciphers or an experienced developer looking for a reliable RC4 implementation, this project is a valuable asset. Explore the code, experiment with encryption and decryption operations, and adapt the implementation to meet your specific needs.
